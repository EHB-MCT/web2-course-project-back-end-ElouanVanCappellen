# Chain Line — Back-end API

This repository contains the back-end of **Chain Line**, a full-stack web application inspired by underground alleycat cycling races.  
The back-end provides a REST API for user authentication, route creation, route retrieval, and community interactions such as liking routes.

The API is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, and is designed to be consumed by a separate front-end application.
